# Parsing Pubmed: R vs. Python

The R v. Py debate is wide-ranging - from performance to packages to preference - but I've always wanted to ask what the biomedical literature actually says over time.

This collection of scripts was my stab at analyzing and visualizing that, which I started sometime mid-pandemic (2021-ish?).  I was never able to work out the error-handling well enough to parse millions of methods sections perfectly, but I was able to churn through about 3 of 4+ million PMC articles available by early 2022.
